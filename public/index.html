<p>We are an ecologically sensitive mining company that tries to always use renewable energy wherever possible.</p>

<p>Mining for rare earth elements need not be a disaster for the environment, and we use methods that help to reduce pollution of the local ecosystems, and reduce the carbon footprint of the elements recovered.</p>

<p>Construction is as sympathetic as we can be to the environment, and we are committed to a better than Government, industry, and regulatory requirements, restoration of the land after we complete extraction; so when we are gone, future generations will be able to enjoy and use the land.</p>

<p>Secure Mining Resources (SMR) is a natural resource mining corporation that has been recently incorporated, and has amalgamated with CSI which was founded in the early 1980s, and therefore is not new to mining mineral resources, and precious metals.</p>

<p>Climate change, as we know it, poses a major risk to the global economy, affecting the wealth and prosperity of all citizens and nations around the world. It will have significant impact on resource availability, energy pricing, infrastructure vulnerability, and company valuations. Corporate environmental sustainability efforts are no longer considered purely voluntary. Customers and shareholders alike now expect meaningful energy and emissions reductions, whilst legislators at every level are creating new regulations that require proof of compliance of climate change adaptation.
The untapped and undervalued Natural Capital Asset class is estimated to be worth in excess of USD $120 trillion, while specific assets represented by institutions and individuals, committed to some sort of divestment from fossil fuels, is estimated at $5 trillion. While awareness and legislation regarding climate change, and the critical importance of Natural Assets grows, there is as yet no transparent mechanism to connect producers of these Natural Assets with the buyers and consumers of those assets.</p>

<p>We are different in that we are ethically driven, and care about polluting our environment. We invest heavily in renewable energy, be it Solar, Wind, Hydro, or Wave; if we can use it, we will. It costs more initially, but the benefits long term far outweigh the costs.</p>

<p>Lithium is one of the fastest growing growth markets in the world.
Lithium has become one of the most important metals around, since it is the major element found in rechargeable batteries. It is used as coolant in nuclear reactors, it is used in air conditioners, medicines, glass, and in the manufacture of aircraft, and of course now cars.
Demand for lithium is growing fast, and the new range of super batteries being developed all use lithium.
In the modern age, lithium has become an element of great value and importance to the general populace. The production process is straightforward, and when it is mined, other minerals such as magnesium, calcium, potassium, and sodium are also obtained and, of course, not wasted.
On our extraction sites we also have large concentrations of high grade, if not medical grade, sulphur, and this is another mineral that is growing in demand.</p>

<p>&lt; src=&ldquo;images/solar01.jpg&rdquo; &gt;</p>

<p>We use a solar-powered lithium extraction system that is highly efficient; we also run a close loop system so toxic waste is not just dumped into the environment. we reuse everything, and remove toxins as we go, so when we are done it will be easier to restore the land.</p>
