We are an ecologicaly sensative mining company that tries to always use renewable energy where ever possible.  

Mining for rare earth elements need not be a disaster for the environment and we use methods that help to reduce polution of the local eco systems and reduce the carbon footprint of the elements recovered.

Construction is as sympathetic as we can be to the environmnet and we are commited to a 100% restoration of the land after we complete extraction so when we are gone future generations will be able to enjoy the land just as it was before we arrived.
