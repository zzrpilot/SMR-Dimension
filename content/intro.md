We are an ecologically sensitive mining company that tries to always use renewable energy wherever possible.  

Mining for rare earth elements need not be a disaster for the environment, and we use methods that help to reduce pollution of the local ecosystems, and reduce the carbon footprint of the elements recovered.

Construction is as sympathetic as we can be to the environment, and we are committed to a better than Government, industry, and regulatory requirements, restoration of the land after we complete extraction; so when we are gone, future generations will be able to enjoy and use the land.
