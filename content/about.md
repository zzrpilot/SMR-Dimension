Secure Mining Resources (SMR) is a natural resource mining corporation that has been recently incorporated, and has amalgamated with CSI which was founded in the early 1980s, and therefore is not new to mining mineral resources, and precious metals. 

Climate change as we know it poses a major risk to the global economy, affecting the wealth and prosperity of all citizens and nations around the world. It will have significant impact on resource availability, energy pricing, infrastructure vulnerability, and company valuations. Corporate environmental sustainability efforts are no longer considered purely voluntary. Customers and shareholders alike now expect meaningful energy and emissions reductions, whilst legislators at every level are creating new regulations that require proof of compliance of climate change adaptation. 
The untapped and undervalued Natural Capital Asset class is estimated to be worth in excess of USD $120 trillion, while specific assets represented by institutions and individuals, committed to some sort of divestment from fossil fuels is estimated at $5 trillion. While awareness and legislation regarding climate change and the critical importance of Natural Assets grows, there is as yet no transparent mechanism to connect producers of these Natural Assets with the buyers and consumers of those assets.

We are different in that we are ethically driven and care about poluting our environment. We invest heavily in renewable energy be it Solar, Wind, Hydro or Wave if we can use it we will. It costs more initially but the benefits long term far outweigh the costs.
