We are making investing in the Lithium future possible for everyone, not just the select few, not just those already more than wealthy ...

A US court survey of a few years ago valued the lithium and rare earth deposits at $125,000,000,000 and a full survey we have underway using modern gravimetric as well as seismic techniques is expected to show there is far more there.

On top of that the titanium deposits were valued at potentialy $5,000,000,000 so its a mine worth some investment!

More will follow soon on how you can invest... But for now here is a map to the area we are working in
