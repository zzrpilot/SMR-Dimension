Lithium is one of the fasted growing growth markets in the world.
Lithium has become one of the most important metals around, since it is the major element found in rechargeable batteries. It is used as coolant in nuclear reactors, it is used in air conditioners, medicines, glass, and in the manufacture of aircraft, and of course now cars.
Demand for Lithium is growing fast and the new range of super batteries being developed all use Lithium.
In the modern age, lithium has become an element of great value and importance to the general populace. The production process is straightforward, and when it is mined, other minerals such as magnesium, calcium, potassium, and sodium are also obtained, and of course not wasted.
On our extraction sites we als ohave large consentrations of high grade if not medical grade Sulpher, and this is another mineral that is growing in demand.

We use a solar powered Lithium extraction system that is highly efficient we also run a close loop system to toxic waste is not just dumped into the environment. we reuse everything and remove toxins as we go so when we are done it will be easier to restore the land.
